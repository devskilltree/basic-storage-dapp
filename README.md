## Description
A basic storage dApp will store data on the blockchain. 

In this tutorial we will start with:
1. The Basic Connect dApp that is a simple front end to connect to the Ethereum network
2. The Basic Storage Contract (MoodContract) that is storing text on the Ethereum Blockchain

This tutorial is a dApp that adds the interaction between the front end and the storage contract. You can find the complete Basic Storage dAll in [index.html](index.html) in this repo.
